            <h1>Nya</h1>
            Hi! Welcome to my Website. I’m Beebz and the little mascot character you see crying all over this site is my fursona, Triste. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to relax like this, but I hope to be able to relive the days of personal websites, even if my main experiences in html had been on gaia, tinierme and other avatar based websites.
            </br></br>
            I’m a recently retired artist trying to recover from insane burnout of having to survive about 7 years on my own after running away from my abusive parent.
            </br></br>
            I’m excited to see what I can share and do! Be patient with me as my crippled ass recovers and rediscovers the joy of my cringe teenage fujoshi years. Those times were when I remember being the happiest in spite of everything, so fuck what anyone thinks now! No more “branding” to worry about!
            </br></br>
            October 8th 2025 Next Plans:
            </br></br>
                Write content and make pages for each of my Worlds, AU's and Characters
                Write content and gather media for Special Interest Shrines
                Convert site colors to material design 3
                Trade website buttons with friends
                Look into potential webrings to join
                Deal with Astro
            </br></br>
            October 24th 2024 Next Plans:
            </br></br>
                Restyle base layout again to mimic old web (2009 era) based on observed qualities
                Port stories and art via the Jekyll posts function
                Make the master blog list less hideous
            </br></br>

<h2>Changelog:</h2>
                        <h3><u>October 8th 2025</u></h3>
                        <ul>
                        - Added my proper <b>Intro</b> with songs, Basic Info and BYF
                        - Had <b>Art</b> and <b>Writing</b> Navigation Links lead to Archive.org and Archive of Our Own. Mirroring already existing pieces onto here will be lower priority
                        - Put <b>Blog</b> as under construction so I wouldnt have to update every single post (which still exists on here but are sort of orphaned link wise). Also added <b>Aethy</b> link as an alternative
                        - Behind the scenes converting from Jekyll to Astro soley because I am limited to Steam Deck right now (don't ask, lol) and I can preview builds on codespace
                        - Hopefully the next one wont take a fucking year. 
                        </ul>
                        <h3><u>October 24th 2024</u></h3>
                        <ul>
                        - Converted Website to a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> based workflow using WSL and Visual Studio Code
                        - Restyled website to make containers bigger, removed aethy feed as the third-party provider mysteriously stopped working.
                        - Added the <a href ="/blog/">BLOG</a> and ported significant posts from my <a href ="https://aethy.com/@Beebz">Aethy</a>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                        <h3><u>July 20th 2024</u></h3>
                        - Started Website Overhaul to have more of a personal feel and less worried about capitalist focused "professionalism" or having a "portfolio".<br>
                        - Here to kick ass and code and my legs hurt.
