            <p>Hi! Welcome to my Website. I’m Beebz and the little mascot character you see crying all over this site is my fursona, Triste. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to relax like this, but I hope to be able to relive the days of personal websites, even if my main experiences in html had been on gaia, tinierme and other avatar based websites.</p>
            <h2>Nice to Meet You!</h2>
            <p>I’m a recently retired artist trying to recover from insane burnout of having to survive about 7 years on my own after running away from my abusive parent.</p>
            <h3>Anyways...</h3>
            <p>I’m excited to see what I can share and do! Be patient with me as my crippled ass recovers and rediscovers the joy of my cringe teenage fujoshi years. Those times were when I remember being the happiest in spite of everything, so fuck what anyone thinks now! No more “branding” to worry about!</p>
